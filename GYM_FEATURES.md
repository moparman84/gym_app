{userProfile?.role === 'admin' && (
  <button onClick={handleCreateWorkout}>
    New Workout
  </button>
)}
```

**Login Tracking:**

// Automatically tracked on every login
await addDoc(collection(db, 'loginHistory'), {

## 🔐 Firestore Security Rules

**Don't forget to add security rules for new collections!**

Add to your Firestore rules:

```javascript
// Login History - admin read only
match /loginHistory/{docId} {
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  allow create: if isSignedIn();
  allow update, delete: if false;
}

// Message Board - all authenticated users
match /messageboard/{postId} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn();
  allow create: if isSignedIn();
  allow update: if isSignedIn() && 
    request.resource.data.authorId == resource.data.authorId;
  allow delete: if isSignedIn() && 
    (resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
}
```
