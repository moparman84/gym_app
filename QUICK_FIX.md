# 🔥 Quick Fix: Leaderboard & Message Board Not Saving

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:**

### **The Problem:**
Your Firestore security rules have the WRONG collection names!

**Collection Name Mismatch:**
- ❌ Your rules reference: `messages` (plural)
- ✅ Your code uses: `messageboard` (one word, no 's')
- **Result:** No permission rules = all writes BLOCKED!

### **The Solution:**
Update Firestore rules with correct collection names.

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE FIX (2 Minutes):**

### **Step 1: Open Firebase Console**
https://console.firebase.google.com

### **Step 2: Go to Rules**
1. Click **"Firestore Database"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Rules"** tab

### **Step 3: Copy & Paste This (Development Mode)**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Click "Publish"**

### **Step 5: Test**
1. Refresh your app (Ctrl + R)
2. Try saving leaderboard
3. Try posting on message board
4. Should work now! ✅

## 🚀 **Alternative: Try This Now:**

### **Option 1: Create a NEW Event (Recommended)**

1. **Delete any test events** you created earlier
2. **Create a fresh event:**
   - Click a date on calendar
   - Fill in: "Test WOD"
   - Click Save
3. **Ctrl+Click the new event**
4. **Add leaderboard entry**
5. **Click "Save Leaderboards"**
6. **Check console** - should see:
   ```
   === SAVING LEADERBOARDS ===
   Event ID: [some-id]
   Main leaderboard entries: [...]
   Event exists, current data: {...}
   Updating event with: {...}
   ✅ SUCCESS! Leaderboards saved to Firestore
   Verified saved data: {...}
   ```

### **Option 2: Manual Fix for Old Events**

If you want to use existing events:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Firestore Database** → **events** collection
3. **Click on your event**
4. **Add two fields:**
   - Field: `mainLeaderboard` | Type: `array` | Value: `[]`
   - Field: `lockerWodLeaderboard` | Type: `array` | Value: `[]`
5. **Save**
6. **Try adding leaderboard again**
