# ✅ Admin Workout Scheduling - FIXED

## 🐛 **The Problem**

When I added the Daily View feature, I accidentally replaced the calendar's `dateClick` handler, which prevented admins from creating events by clicking dates.

**What happened:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Working):
dateClick={handleDateClick}  // Opens event modal for admins

// AFTER Daily View (Broken):
dateClick={(arg) => {
  setSelectedDate(new Date(arg.dateStr));
  setViewMode('daily');  // Just switches view, no event creation
}}
```

## ✅ **The Fix**

I've restored the admin scheduling functionality in **TWO WAYS**:

### **Method 1: Calendar View (Click on Dates)**
- **Restored:** Original `dateClick={handleDateClick}` behavior
- **How to use:** 
  1. Stay in "Calendar" view
  2. Click any empty date cell
  3. Event creation modal opens ✅

### **Method 2: Daily View (New Button)**
- **Added:** "Schedule Workout for This Day" button
- **Location:** In Daily View, below the date navigation
- **How to use:**
  1. Switch to "Daily View"
  2. Navigate to desired day
  3. Click big blue "Schedule Workout for This Day" button
  4. Event creation modal opens ✅

   - See existing workouts side-by-side
   - Use button to add more workouts to same day
   - Review leaderboards

### **Creating Multiple Workouts for Same Day:**

1. Switch to Daily View
2. Navigate to the day
3. Click "Schedule Workout" button
4. Create first workout (e.g., "Main WOD 9am")
5. Click button again
6. Create second workout (e.g., "Locker WOD 12pm")
7. Both appear side-by-side! ✅

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ **Calendar View**: Clicking dates opens event modal
2. ✅ **Daily View**: Blue button appears below date
3. ✅ **Daily View**: Clicking button opens event modal
4. ✅ **Both Views**: Can successfully create and save events
5. ✅ **Events appear** immediately after saving

## 🎉 **Summary**

**Problem:** Admins couldn't schedule workouts after Daily View was added  
**Cause:** Calendar date click was replaced with view switcher  
**Solution:** Restored original behavior + added convenient button in Daily View  
**Result:** Admins can now schedule workouts from BOTH views! ✅

**Both methods work perfectly now! Use whichever is more convenient for your workflow.**
