# 🎉 Latest Updates - Alternative Athletics

## ✅ **All New Features Implemented:**

---

## 1. 🏋️ **Members Can View Workout Details**

### **What Changed:**
When members click on a calendar event, they now see a **detailed workout modal** instead of just a message.

### **What Members See:**
- ✅ Main workout with all exercises
- ✅ Sets, reps, weight, duration for each exercise
- ✅ Exercise notes
- ✅ Locker WOD (if added)
- ✅ Button to view leaderboard (if available)

### **How It Works:**
1. Member clicks any event on calendar
2. Modal pops up with workout details
3. Shows linked workout from workout library
4. Shows Locker WOD exercises (if any)
5. "View Leaderboard" button if results are posted

---

## 2. 🔥 **Locker WOD - Daily Bonus Workout**

### **What Is Locker WOD:**
A bonus workout that's **specific to one day** and **doesn't go in the workout library**.

### **How Admins Add It:**
1. Create or edit a calendar event
2. Scroll down to "Locker WOD (Optional)" section
3. Enter workout name (e.g., "Burpee Challenge")
4. Add description
5. Add exercises with sets/reps/weight/duration
6. Save event

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Not saved to workout library** - only for that day
- ✅ **Separate leaderboard** - tracks Main Workout and Locker WOD separately
- ✅ **Orange highlight** - easily distinguishable from main workout
- ✅ **Full exercise editor** - same functionality as workout creation

### **Example Locker WOD:**
```
Name: Max Burpees
Description: As many burpees as possible in 5 minutes
Exercises:
  - Burpees (AMRAP, 5:00)
```

---

## 3. 📅 **Date-Only Calendar Events**

### **What Changed:**
Event creation now only asks for **dates**, not times.

### **Before:**
- Start Date/Time (had hour/minute picker)
- End Date/Time (had hour/minute picker)

### **Now:**
- Start Date (date only)
- End Date (date only)

### **Why:**
Gym classes typically just need to know the day, not specific start/end times. Simpler and cleaner!

---

## 4. 🗄️ **Leaderboard Data Now Saves to Firestore**

### **Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Events now initialize with empty leaderboard arrays
- ✅ Detailed console logging for debugging
- ✅ Verification after save
- ✅ Fresh data fetched when reopening

### **How to Verify:**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database → events collection
3. Click any event
4. Should see fields:
   - `mainLeaderboard: []` (array)
   - `lockerWodLeaderboard: []` (array)
