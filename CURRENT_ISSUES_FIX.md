# 🔧 Current Issues & Fixes

## Issue 1: ❌ Replies Failing to Post

### **Root Cause:**
Firestore security rules are blocking writes to the `messageboard` collection.

### **Quick Fix (2 Minutes):**

1. **Open Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Go to Firestore Database → Rules**
3. **Replace with this:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Click "Publish"**
5. **Wait 30 seconds**
6. **Try posting a reply again**

### **What to Check in Browser Console (F12):**

When you try to post a reply, you should see:
```
=== ADDING REPLY ===
Post ID: [post-id]
Reply content: [your message]
Updating document with reply: {...}
✅ Reply added successfully!
```

**If you see this error:**
```
❌ Error adding reply
Error code: permission-denied
```
**Then your Firestore rules are blocking the write!**

### **Detailed Diagnosis:**

Open browser console (F12) and try to post a reply. Look for:

- ✅ **Success**: "Reply added successfully!" - Rules are working
- ❌ **Error**: "permission-denied" - Rules need updating
- ❌ **Error**: "Missing or insufficient permissions" - Not logged in or rules issue

## Issue 2: ❌ Workouts Still Displaying Vertically

### **Root Cause:**
The Daily View might not be active, or screen size is too small to show side-by-side layout.

### **Fix:**

1. **Switch to Daily View**
   - Look at top right of Training Schedule page
   - Click the **"Daily View"** button (with columns icon)
   - Make sure it's selected (white background)

2. **Check Screen Size**
   - Workouts display side-by-side on screens **768px+ (tablets/desktops)**
   - On mobile phones (< 768px), they stack vertically by design
   - Try making your browser window wider

3. **Verify You're on the Right View**

**Calendar View:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Calendar] [Daily View]        │  ← Toggle buttons
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   October 2024                  │
│   Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat   │
│    1   2   3   4   5   6   7    │
│   ...                           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Daily View (What you want):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Calendar] [Daily View]        │  ← Daily View selected
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  ← Monday, October 21, 2024 →   │
├─────────────────┬───────────────┤
│  Main WOD       │ Locker WOD    │  ← Side by side!
│  9:00 AM        │ 12:00 PM      │
│  🏆 Leaderboard │ 🏆 Leaderboard│
└─────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

### **Steps to Get Side-by-Side Layout:**

1. **Go to Training Schedule page**
2. **Click "Daily View" button** (top right)
3. **Make sure your browser window is at least 768px wide**
4. **You should see workouts side by side**

If you still see them vertically:
- Check if you only have 1 workout scheduled (then only 1 column)
- Try resizing browser window to full screen
- Check browser console (F12) for any errors

## 🆘 **Still Not Working?**

### **Issue: Replies still failing**

**Check:**
1. Are you logged in? (Check top right corner)
2. Did you publish Firestore rules?
3. Did you wait 30-60 seconds after publishing?
4. Did you hard refresh? (Ctrl + Shift + R)

**Copy from console:**
- Any error messages (red text)
- The full error object
- Network tab status codes

### **Issue: Layout still vertical**

**Check:**
1. Is "Daily View" button selected (white background)?
2. What is your screen width? (Press F12, check responsive mode)
3. How many workouts scheduled for that day?
4. Any console errors?

**Take screenshots:**
- The toggle buttons (should show Daily View selected)
- The full page layout
- Browser console (F12)

## 📝 **Summary:**

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix | Verification |
|-------|------------|-----|--------------|
| Replies failing | Firestore rules blocking writes | Update rules to allow authenticated users | Post reply, check console for success |
