# Calendar Event Labels Update

## ✅ What Changed

Training banners on the calendar are now **non-clickable labels** that are part of the day's click area.

## 🎯 Behavior

### Before:
- Events were clickable separately from the day
- Had to click precisely on the day (not the event) to navigate
- Events had hover effects and cursor changes

### After:
- Events are visual labels only (not clickable)
- Clicking **anywhere** on the day (including on events) navigates to daily view
- No hover effects or cursor changes on events
- Events still display title and trophy icon

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. CalendarPage.jsx
```javascript
events={events.map(event => ({
  ...event,
  title: (event.mainLeaderboard?.length > 0 || event.lockerWodLeaderboard?.length > 0) 
    ? `🏆 ${event.title}` 
    : event.title,
  display: 'block',
  classNames: ['non-interactive-event'] // Makes event non-clickable
}))}
eventInteractive={false} // Disables event interaction
```

### 2. index.css
```css
/* Non-interactive event labels - not clickable, part of day click area */
.fc-event.non-interactive-event {
  pointer-events: none !important;  /* Clicks pass through to day */
  cursor: default !important;       /* No pointer cursor */
  opacity: 0.9;                     /* Slightly transparent */
}
```

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **pointer-events: none** - Makes events "invisible" to mouse clicks
2. Clicks pass through to the day cell underneath
3. **dateClick** handler catches all clicks on the day
4. Navigates to daily view regardless of where you click

## 🔧 Technical Details

- `display: 'block'` - Renders as block element (normal event)
- `classNames: ['non-interactive-event']` - Applies custom CSS class
- `eventInteractive={false}` - FullCalendar property to disable interaction
- `eventClick` handler returns nothing (already implemented)

## ✨ User Experience

**For All Users:**
- Click anywhere on a calendar day → Navigate to that day's workout view
- Events are visible but clearly non-interactive
- Consistent clicking behavior across entire day cell

**For Admins:**
- Same behavior as regular users on calendar
- Edit events through daily view instead

## 📱 Responsive

- Works on mobile and desktop
- Touch-friendly (entire day is tappable)
- No accidental event clicks

## 🎉 Benefits

1. ✅ **Better UX** - Larger click target (entire day)
2. ✅ **Less confusion** - Clear that events are labels
3. ✅ **Mobile-friendly** - Easier to tap on small screens
4. ✅ **Consistent** - Same behavior everywhere on the day

## 🧪 Testing

1. Go to Calendar page
2. Click on a day with an event
3. ✅ Should navigate to daily view
4. Click directly on an event banner
5. ✅ Should still navigate to daily view (not open event)
6. Hover over event
7. ✅ Should show default cursor (not pointer)

## Notes

- Lint warnings about `@tailwind` and `@apply` are normal for Tailwind CSS projects
- Events still show trophy icon (🏆) when leaderboards exist
- Event colors and styling remain the same
- Only interaction behavior changed
